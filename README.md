**MONEY MOVEMENTS PROJECT**

Brief introduction:
- This project consists on a django webserver where the users can import their bank account movements via csv file or insert them manually.
- Once the movements are in the app, the user would be able to analyse them and to see where the money is spent.

Why is it interesting?

This project uses django 1.7, angularjs 1.3, bootstrap 3.2, MySQL 5.6 so it lets my play with python again and learn and understand the very basics of
angularjs. Alongside with that, it goes through the analysis of data with complex queries and algorithms.
